## Overview

Veve is a modern testing framework designed specifically for TypeScript projects, offering type safety and simplicity without compromising on power or flexibility. With zero configuration required, you can start writing and running tests immediately while enjoying full TypeScript support and autocompletion.

## Installation

You can install Veve globally using npm:

<Tabs items={['npm', 'pnpm','yarn']}>
  <Tab value="npm">
   ```bash
   npm i -g veve
   ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="pnpm">
    ```bash
    pnpm install veve
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="yarn">
    ```bash
    yarn install veve
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Alternatively, use our interactive setup wizard:

```bash
npx veve-setup
```

### Writing Your First Test

Create a new TypeScript file and write your test:

```ts twoslash title="test.test.ts"
import "veve";

const add = (a: number, b: number): number => a + b;

it("should add two numbers", () => {
    assert(add(1, 2)).toBe(3)
});

run();
```

### Running Tests

Execute your tests using the `veve` command:

```bash
veve
```

That's all you need to get started! No additional configuration or setup required.
