Creates a new assertion instance for the provided value.
- This function performs non-throwing assertions, which do not raise errors on failure.
- Use this for scenarios where you want to test conditions without interrupting execution.

## Parameters

### received

`any`

The value to be strictly asserted.

## Returns

[`Assertion`](../classes/Assertion.md)

An `Assertion` instance configured to silently handle failures.

## Example

```ts
is(42).toBe(42); // Passes
is("hello").toBe("world"); // Does not throw, but marks failure
```
