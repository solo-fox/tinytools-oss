**Veve** is a streamlined testing framework designed to simplify writing and managing tests. This guide will help you get started and make the most of **Veve's** features.

## Importing Veve

Veve minimizes boilerplate code.

```ts twoslash title="test.test.ts"
import "veve" // Import Veve for auto-completion

it("should pass", () => {})

run() // Run the tests
```

This is all you need to start writing tests with Veve!

## TypeScript & Auto-Completion

### TypeScript Support

Veve is an **ESM** (ECMAScript Module) and does **not** support CommonJS. For the best experience, we recommend using **TypeScript** in your testing environment.

To enable TypeScript support, change the file extension from `.js` to `.ts`. This will provide type checking and auto-completion.

### Enable Auto-Completion

To ensure full auto-completion and type safety, import Veve at the top of each test file:

```ts twoslash title="test.test.ts"
import "veve" // Automatically loads types for improved auto-completion
```

This ensures that the necessary types and JSDoc comments are available, making it easier to write and maintain your tests.

## Running Tests

Once you've written your tests, call the `run()` function at the end of your file to execute them and generate a **TestReport**.

```ts twoslash title="test.test.ts"
import "veve"

it("should pass", () => {})

run() // Crucial to trigger test execution and generate a TestReport
```

**Important:** The `run()` function is essential. Without it, your tests won't execute, and no results will be generated.
